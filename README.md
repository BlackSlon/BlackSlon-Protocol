The **BlackSlon Protocol** is a next-generation decentralized framework designed to dismantle centralized bottlenecks in European Energy Wholesale markets. By leveraging deterministic mathematical stabilizers, we bridge the gap between high-frequency energy trading and on-chain transparency.

## ⚡ Core Innovation

Traditional markets suffer from fragmentation and high entry barriers. BlackSlon introduces **Micro-Granularity**, allowing participants to trade energy in units as small as **100 kWh**, effectively shattering the MWh-block barrier.

### The Pricing Engine
At the heart of our **protocol** lies the autonomous bonding curve:

$$P = a \cdot e^{b \cdot S}$$

This formula ensures that **Liquidty** is algorithmic and deterministic, providing an instant counterparty for every trade regardless of legacy exchange hours.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Explore the White Paper:** Read our full documentation in the `/docs` folder.
2. **Connect:** Use the API Gateway to bridge your trading bots to the local Energy Indexes.
3. **Govern:** Stake €BLSN to participate in the DAO expansion.
