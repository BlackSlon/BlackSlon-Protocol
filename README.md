# BlackSlon Energy Indexes: The Decentralized Energy Marketplace Protocol
BlackSlon is a next-generation **protocol** designed to dismantle centralized bottlenecks in European Energy Wholsale markets (power, natural gas, oil products). Inspired by the "Zero Form" of Kazimierz Malewicz and the market revolution of Marc Rich, I strip away inefficient layers of traditional trading.

## The Vision
I have distilled energy valuation stripping away energy legacy complexity and its valuation of most exhausting layers: Expiration, Entry/Exit Spread, Credit/Counterparty Risk, Barrier to Entry and Price Curve/Seasonality. It's a real-time Energy Index generated not by human actions, but by on-chain Liquidty.

## Price Determination Formula
Our protocol utilizes a deterministic bonding curve to ensure transparent price discovery:

$$P = a \cdot e^{b \cdot S}$$
